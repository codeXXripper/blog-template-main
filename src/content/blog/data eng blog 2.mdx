## Data Engineering Zoomcamp, Week 2

### Project infrastructure modules in GCP:

* Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Data Lake
* BigQuery: Data Warehouse

### Initial Setup

For this course, we'll use a free version (upto EUR 300 credits).

1. Create an account with your Google email ID
2. Setup your first [project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) if you haven't already
   * eg. "DTC DE Course", and note down the "Project ID" (we'll use this later when deploying infra with TF)
3. Setup [service account & authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) for this project
   * Grant Viewer role to begin with.
   * Download service-account-keys (.json) for auth.
4. Download [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) for local setup
5. Set environment variable to point to your downloaded GCP keys:

```python
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = ".../keys/gcp-cred.json"

# Refresh token / session, and verify authentication
gcloud auth application -default login
```

### Setup for Access

1. [IAM Roles](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) for Service account:
   * Go to the IAM section of IAM & Admin [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam)
   * Click the Edit principal icon for your service account.
   * Add these roles in addition to Viewer : Storage Admin + Storage Object Admin + BigQuery Admin
2. Enable these APIs for your project:
   * [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iam.googleapis.com)
   * [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/iamcredentials.googleapis.com)
3. Please ensure GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS env-var is set.

```python
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "<path/to/your/service-account-authkeys>.json"
```

### Terraform Overview

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

1. What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)?
   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/), used for provisioning infrastructure resources
   * supports DevOps best practices for change management
   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state for testing and production environments
2. What is IaC?
   * Infrastructure-as-Code
   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.
3. Some advantages
   * Infrastructure lifecycle management
   * Version control commits
   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8S…
   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments

#### Declarations

* **terraform**: configure basic Terraform settings to provision your infrastructure
  * **required\_version**: minimum Terraform version to apply to your configuration
  * **backend**: stores Terraform's "state" snapshots, to map real-world resources to your configuration.
    * **local**: stores state file locally as terraform.tfstate
  * **required\_providers**: specifies the providers required by the current module
* **provider**:
  * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage
  * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.
* **resource**
  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure
  * Project modules/resources: google\_storage\_bucket, google\_bigquery\_dataset, google\_bigquery\_table
* **variable** & **locals**
  * runtime arguments and constants

##### Terraform sample

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "4.51.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "google" {
  # Credentials only needs to be set if you do not have the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS set
  # credentials = "../../keys/gcp-cred.json"
  project = "terrform-demo-412419"
  region = "us-central1"
  zone = "us-central1-c"

}


resource "google_storage_bucket" "terra-demo" {
  name = "terrform-demo-412419-bucket"
  location = "US"
  force_destroy = true


  lifecycle_rule {
    condition {
      age = 1
    }
    action {
      type = "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload"
    }
  }
}


Variables in Terraform


resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "demo_dataset" {
  dataset_id = "ny_taxi_dataset"

}

variable "credentials" {
  description = "My Credentials"
  default     = "../../keys/gcp-cred.json"
}

variable "project" {
  description = "Project"
  default     = "terrform-demo-412419"
}

variable "region" {
  description = "Region"
  default     = "us-central1"
}

variable "location" {
  description = "Project Location"
  default     = "US"
}

variable "bq_dataset_name" {
  description = "My BigQuery Dataset Name"
  default     = "ny_taxi_dataset"
}

variable "gcs_bucket_name" {
  description = "My Storage Bucket Name"
  default     = "terraform-ny-taxi-bucket"
}

variable "gcs_storage_class" {
  description = "Bucket Storage Class"
  default     = "STANDARD"
}
```

#### Execution steps

\# Refresh service-account's auth-token for this session

gcloud auth application-default login

1. terraform init:
   * Initializes & configures the backend, installs plugins/providers, & checks out an existing configuration from a version control
2. terraform plan:
   * Matches/previews local changes against a remote state, and proposes an Execution Plan.
3. terraform apply:
   * Asks for approval to the proposed plan, and applies changes to cloud
4. terraform destroy
   * Removes your stack from the Cloud
